# GAML

A library for reading the Generalized Analytical Markup Language (GAML) file format, a generic XML data format for scientific data, introduced by Thermo Fisher Scientific.

## Notes

* GAML version 1.20 is not added as allowed version in the 1.20 schema. As it is clearly implied this library accepts it as a value.
* Additional flexibility has been introduced with GAML versions 1.10 and 1.20. This library accepts the relaxations/extensions for all versions.
